Hello! I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [University of Southern California](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/), supervised by [Shrikanth (Shri) Narayanan](https://sail.usc.edu/people/shri.html). My research interests are in Speech Processing, including Speaker Diarization and Automatic Speech Recognition, as well as Multimodal AI. Particularly, I have been working in the application domain of Child ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder).

Previously, I obtained my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from [UC San Diego](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/). I was born and raised at Nagoya city, Japan until ([High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokai_High_School) alumni), and my Japanese name is 徐安峰 / Yasumine Jo.

I am looking for research internship opportunities for summer 2024!
